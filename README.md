## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the design of a **Digital Music Generator** using both discrete ICs (555 Timer, 74163, etc.) and a microcontroller-based simulation (Arduino Uno). Implemented as part of the Digital Electronics Lab, it combines **sequential logic**, **timing circuits**, and **waveform generation** to simulate musical output through digital logic simulation and embedded systems.

The goal is to build a simple yet functional **digital audio tone generator**, with user interaction and timing control, simulated on TinkerCAD.
